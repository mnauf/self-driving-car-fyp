I am excited to share that that my self-driving car video lecture has become a part of "Foundations of Artificial Intelligence" course by instructor Zeeshan-ul-hassan Usmani from Alnafi Online Education.

This is a 16-minute video lecture where I have explained my final year project journey of self-driving cars and discussed the most asked question of juniors "How to select FYP".
